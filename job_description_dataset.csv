CTO,"HealthyWage is reinventing weight loss and fitness using cash prizes. Our weight loss challenges are based on new behavioral economics research demonstrating the efficacy of using money to provide motivation, structure and accountability to drive behavior change.  Our most popular product, the HealthyWager, lets people make a “bet” on their own weight loss and win up to $10,000. Last year, HealthyWage awarded more than $10 million in prizes. You can read about our company in hundreds of earned media pieces, including Good Morning America, the Today show, the New York Times, etc., but our work has just begun, and we need strong, creative leadership to take us to the next level.


About the Position

This is a dream job for an ambitious, smart technology leader.  Put simply, our products are fun to work on and are making a significant, positive, impact on society.  Our company is at the perfect size right now for you to be able to rely on extensive resources but still get your hands dirty working on a wide variety of challenging problems and puzzles.  


You will lead our Product & Engineering Department, which consists of about a dozen full-time product and engineering professionals plus numerous vendors, contractors, SAAS subscriptions and other tools.  Although you will primarily focus on supporting these goals with outstanding technology, your business skills, interests and leadership need to shine. The department has several areas of focus:


Growth Product.  You and your department will support the Marketing & Growth teams to build awareness of our products and maximize revenue per visitor.  You will ensure that we have and properly implement all the right technology and that we make the most of it in support of our marketing and growth objectives.  You will help us optimize our use of Facebook’s developer and advertiser tools; Google’s marketing tools, including Analytics, Optimize and Ads; Iterable; Hotjar; our proprietary reporting tools; and marketing and growth tools that you’ve used that we haven’t but should.  You’ll help us masterfully manage everything from pixels to events.


You’ll use your existing expertise to bring data science to the forefront across the organization to make data a core strength. This includes helping the team use data about users, ensuring that we have and properly use the best BI tools, and leading the team to analyze and cull breakthroughs.  You’ll also lead our use of math, software, and machine learning to build better models and other tools to forecast weight loss success and other customer behavior.


Product Development.  You’ll lead the team to develop and execute on a roadmap consisting of new products and new features (and improvements on existing features) for existing products.  This includes managing architecture, scrum teams, Product Manager(s), creative staff (in conjunction with the Head of Marketing), Q/A and any other machinery that may be required to deliver on our Product Development goals.


Stability at Scale.  We support a significant volume of users, which tends to spike sharply at times because we run TV ads and other marketing campaigns, and because our corporate clients sometimes send out mass emails to promote our B2B products to their workforces.  It is imperative that we maintain stability at all times and at scale, and ensure that 100% of customers have a good experience. Our company has been too small to require full time devops, so these tasks have typically fallen to the Head of Engineering.  


Security.  As our profile has increased, so have attempted attacks.  In this regard, your job is very hands-on. You will directly control Cloudflare and several other tools and respond to attacks when they happen.  You will also maintain and constantly improve our plan for forecasting attack vectors, managing vulnerabilities, contracting with third-parties for scans, pen tests and audits, and otherwise helping us maintain outstanding security to protect customer and company data and ensure that our operations continue uninterrupted.


Architecture, Quality & Management.  Provide outstanding management of the department, including:

Ensuring that we have the right staff to achieve our objectives and to allow you to delegate properly so that you’re available for the most complex and important engineering and business problems.
Ensuring that HealthyWage becomes a standard-bearer for the various parts of our technology stack, which includes mobile apps (iOS and Android), Python, Django and SQL.
Establishing clear standards and best practices for documentation, design, implementation, testing, troubleshooting, and maintenance, and ensure that the department adheres to the standards and practices.
Owning the budget and demonstrating value against the budget with KPIs and outstanding reporting.
Developing strong management practices and operational processes to ensure efficiency and to minimize waste.
Increasing the quality of our applications by introducing and enforcing high standards at every level.

Despite the many executive responsibilities, HealthyWage is still a small company, and you must be the sort of person who, when delegation doesn’t make sense and the need arises, can roll up her/his sleeves and dive into the nitty-gritty.


Required Qualifications

Significant experience in an in-house leadership position in a growth company.
Significant experience in developing/selecting and managing growth and marketing tools.
Significant experience with data science.
Significant experience in an in-house leadership position in a company that develops web and mobile applications where the company’s customers are the end-users.
Outstanding academic and professional credentials.
Experience building brilliant mobile app teams and corresponding API teams is helpful, and so is experience creating masterful architecture (hardware, software, etc.) to support consumer-facing applications on mobile apps and websites.
Significant P&L-level experience."

CEO,"General Background

The Mental Health Association Oklahoma (MHAOK) is conducting a national search for the organization’s next CEO (Chief Executive Officer.) The current Chief Executive Officer is retiring.

MHAOK is a private non-profit organization dedicated to promoting mental health, preventing mental disorders and achieving victory over mental illness through advocacy, education, research, service and housing. The Association was chartered in 1955 and initially focused on addressing needs in the Tulsa area. In 2014 the Association expanded state wide and adopted its current name. The Association is a United Way funded agency which regularly receives significant support through the Tulsa United Way, and was awarded the largest grant ever made by the United Way of Central Oklahoma to implement a case management program that helps people experiencing homelessness move into and maintain housing. MHAOK is accredited by the Council on Accreditation.

The agency has a staff of 185 and serves approximately 6,000 people per year across the state. With its headquarters in Tulsa, the organization offers highly regarded services in mental health outreach, prevention and education services, recovery services, employment programming, counseling, criminal justice reform and housing. The agency’s “Housing First” model is “a nationally recognized homeless assistance approach that prioritizes providing permanent housing to people experiencing homelessness, thus ending their homelessness and serving as a platform from which they can pursue personal goals and improve their quality of life.” With over 1,500 units spread across 22 properties in Tulsa, and 150 units and growing in Oklahoma City, MHAOK: 1) provides access to housing for individuals experiencing homelessness and have a disability, 2) prevents additional homelessness by offering truly affordable housing, and 3) preserves the affordable housing stock in the community that is at risk of redevelopment.

The Mental Health Association Oklahoma is noted for its advocacy, outreach and education, in addition to its services. The annual Zarrow Mental Health Symposium is considered one of the premiere gatherings for mental health professionals in the nation. The agency also provides state-wide education and outreach through community events, local media and mental health training, including “QPR” (Question, Persuade and Refer) suicide training. Advocacy for criminal justice reform is focused on improving the treatment of those with mental illness in the criminal justice arena.

The agency has a budget of roughly $20M per year. Sources of revenue include income from housing, service grants and fees, as well as proceeds from charitable contributions and a highly successful event called “Carnival.” The agency has a Board of 41 and an Advisory Council comprised of mental health experts and community leaders.
